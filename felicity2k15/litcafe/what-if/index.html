                            <p>Scenarios given below have far reaching effects on human history, society and culture. Your contributions can be hilarious or serious, factual or supernatural. But they have to be imaginative and should be able to hold the interest of the reader.<br>
<br>
<strong>Rules</strong><br>
<br>
1. You can submit any number of submissions for any number of situations you want. <br>
2. There is no minimum or maximum word limit. A sentence would do just as fine as a two page story, as long as they manage to grab the reader?s interest.<br>
3. You can make any number of reasonable assumptions you want, as long as they do not contradict the ones given.<br>
4. Spelling errors will strictly not be tolerated. SMS language counts as spelling errors too. Appropriate grammar is appreciated.<br>
<br>
<strong><br>
What would happen if../..<br>
<br>
1. Lying has not been discovered as yet. Everything people say to each other is true, spoken in a natural manner as if stating a simple fact, regardless of how offensive or inappropriate we might see it today.<br>
<br>
2. Pooping is an annual affair instead of daily. There would be ~3 days every year when all a person would do all day is sit and empty his bowels.<br>
<br>
3. You have an opportunity to begin a religion, involving anything with a guaranteed minimum number of 100,000 followers.<br>
<br>
4. The sounds of pleasure and/or pain during sex are turned into songs. Singing songs is a consequence of having sex.<br>
<br>
5. People exist on earth only as souls. They change their body every 24 hours and continue their lives in another body. The only caveat is that the age of the destination body is exactly the same as the age of the source body.<br>
<br>
6. Having intercourse more than once in a lifetime results in the immediate death of those involved.<br>
<br>
7. Consuming any animal turns people into that animal and that goes on recursively, with a constant level of memory and intelligence. Holds true only for beings that begin existence as a human being.<br>
<br>
8. Faces and voices didn't exist. People would be recognized, judged and comprehended only on by their written word.<br>
